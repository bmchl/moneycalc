learning swift &amp; converting my school python projects to swiftui apps.

this repo does not currently contain the final version of this project or a version that is able to be run directly on an iOS device, as I have been using Swift Playgrounds to learn Swift & SwiftUI. These files are simply different files I've been using to test out my code. A working version will be uploaded once I finalize it.
